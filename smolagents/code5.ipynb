According to the University of California – Santa Barbra, ice cream will melt at about 31 degrees Fahrenheit or -3 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is about 32 degrees Fahrenheit, but the ice cream is affected by the salt content. Adding salt to a liquid lowers the freezing point of the substance. The reason why salt affects the freezing point of liquids is because of the way liquids freeze. The molecules in a liquid are constantly moving, but as the liquid becomes colder, the molecules slow down causing it to freeze. When salt molecules are added to the liquid, the two molecules combine so that more heat must be removed in order for the liquid to freeze.', 'score': 0.5820878, 'raw_content': None}, {'title': \"What temperature does ice cream melt? - Chef's Resource\", 'url': 'https://www.chefsresource.com/what-temperature-does-ice-cream-melt/', 'content': 'What temperature does ice cream melt? What temperature does ice cream melt? **What Temperature Does Ice Cream Melt?** The melting process of ice cream is influenced by the fat and sugar content, as well as the presence of air bubbles. In addition, the process of churning during the ice cream-making process incorporates air into the mixture, which affects its melting properties. **What causes ice cream to melt?** When the temperature rises above freezing point, the fat and sugar in the ice cream begin to soften, causing it to melt. **At what temperature should ice cream be stored to prevent melting?** The type of container can influence how quickly ice cream melts.

The rapid melting of ice cream is a result of a complex interplay of factors, including temperature, surface area, air content, ingredient composition, and environmental conditions. A: A larger surface area allows for more contact with the surrounding air, which transfers heat to the ice cream, increasing the melting rate. Q: What ingredients in ice cream slow down its melting rate? A: Fat and stabilizers can help to slow down heat transfer and improve the texture and stability of ice cream, making it less prone to melting.

In ice cream, liquid particles of fat—called fat globules—are spread throughout a mixture of water, sugar, and ice, along with air bubbles (Fig. 1). A big reason why ice cream tastes so good is because of its high fat content. Just like oil floats to the top of water, the fat content in ice cream has a tendency to separate out, as well. This is good in milk, but not so good in ice cream, in which the fat droplets should coalesce to trap air. Soft-serve ice cream, or soft serve, for short, contains less fat and more air than regular ice cream. Another difference is that custard contains much less air than ice cream.', 'score': 0.07870625, 'raw_content': None}]\n"
